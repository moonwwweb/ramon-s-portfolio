        <p>
          Hi! I'm Ramon a Computer Science graduate aiming to make my mark as a
          front-end developer. I’m passionate about creating clean, responsive,
          and user-focused websites using modern web technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy bringing ideas to life through code, with an eye for design
          and a love for smooth, intuitive user experiences. When I’m not
          building interfaces, I’m usually enjoying a good cup of coffee and
          exploring ways to level up my skills.
        </p>
